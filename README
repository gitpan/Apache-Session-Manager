Apache/Session/Manager version 0.02
===================================

Apache::Session::Manager provides a wrapper around Apache::Session which adds the following :

  * Short term session tracking using cookies or URLs (query string / POST data rather than URL munging)
  * Long term user tracking with cookies and query string
  * User recognition through query string
  * Login, logout, create new account, remove cookies - all operating with your favourite database and schema!

It needs to be subclassed by your own module, which provides the methods to interact 
with your database - ie you can integrate this module into you own database schema.

Apache::Session::Manager is not a "drop in" module - it requires a bit of work on your part to make
 it work - but once that work is done, it makes a lot of user and session management easy.  Any 
website that wants to have any sort of long term relationship with a user needs to be able to track a 
user through a session, allow the user to register, and issue them with a password challenge
before allowing them to view restricted pages... which is exactly what this module does.

All you need to provide is 6 subroutines which speak to your database to perform a few simple 
functions (looking up a username etc).
